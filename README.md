# Interactive Map

An interactive map using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson)

Map data taken from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) and transformed into a TopoJSON using [MapShaper](https://mapshaper.org/)

Based off of code from [Mike Bostock's GeoJSON in Three.js](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/geojson-in-three-js)
